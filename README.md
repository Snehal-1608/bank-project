## Project Name - Bank Project
I have created my first project bank management system in python.  In this project,system allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, logging in, depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and viewing balances.Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming in Python, particularly in the context of building a banking system. 
## Table of Contents

2. Login

4. Withdraw amount
5. View balance
6. Transfer amount
## How to use this Project

## Result
* The project successfully defines two classes, "User" and "Bank", demonstrating the principles of object-oriented programming.
* Inheritance is employed, with the "Bank" class inheriting from the "User" class, illustrating the concept of code reusability.
